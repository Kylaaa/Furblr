<sub>FurAffinity but with a Tumblr layout.</sub>

    <summary><h2>Motivations and Inspirations</h2></summary>
    <p>FurAffinity as a website has a ton of amazing features that, in my opinion, are poorly organized. Furblr is an attempt to wrangle all of the different elements into a mobile app experience like Tumblr's.</p>
    <p>The main focus of this project is to organize the types of things this website has to offer into meaningful categories. Those include :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Home Screen</b> - a content feed based on the submitted artwork, photographs, writing, and personal journals of the artists you follow.</li>
        <li><b>The Search and Discover Screen</b> - a page for seeing the latest artwork on FA and searching for new artists to follow. Commission information for artists you follow will be linked here as well!</li>
        <li><b>Your Messages Screen</b> - a page for viewing all of the private messages you have sent and received.</li>
        <li><b>You Notifications Screen</b> - a page that shows you who has been favoriting your posts, or leaving notes and shouts.</li>
        <li><b>Your Profile Screen</b> - a page to see your public facing profile, and configure your personal and app settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some notable features that I plan to include are : </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tag Blacklisting</b> - don't like gore, watersports, diapers, or any other specific content? Add it to the blacklist and any tagged post will not show up in your feed or search results. (I cannot understand how FA doesn't support this yet)</li>
        <li><b>YCH, Reminders, and Commission Filtering</b>- love an artist's work but don't love seeing constant ads for their stuff? Posts like these will show up in a dedicated section of the app so you can go shopping for it if you're in the mood.</li>
        <li><b>Series links integrated into navigation</b> - the UI should make it super easy to read comics, and link between pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With my current job and household work-load, I don't have time to continue development on this.</p>
    <p>I can give no guarantees if/when future updates may come out.</p>

    <summary><h2>Installation Guide</h2></summary>
    <p style="color:#aa0"><big><b>Minimum Supported Version : Android 8</b></big></p>
    <p style="color:#0a0"><big><b>Suggested Version : Android 13</b></big></p>
    <p>Until Furblr fully supports a SFW mode, there is no way to distribute it through the Google Play App Store.</p>
    <p>The recommended way to install the app right now is to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-sideload-install-android-app-apk/">sideload</a> the latest APK from the <a href="https://github.com/Kylaaa/Furblr/releases">Releases section</a>. This is unfortunately very unsafe as any random APK could be malware. I promise that it isn't, the source code is public for you to read through.</p>
    <p>Anyways, follow these steps :<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the Releases page of this repository.</li>
        <li>Expand the Assets section.</li>
        <li>Download the furblr apk file to your device.</li>
        <li>Tap on the downloaded file to install it. You may need to click through some warnings telling you this is an unsafe thing to do.</li>
    </ol>

    <summary><h2>Login Guide</h2></summary>
    <p>FurAffinity does not support 3rd party app login, so you must log in using a pop-up to the website. This process is unfortunately not consistent, so you may need to try a few times.</p>
    <p>This is not a good process, and may never be, so please bear with me while you try to log in.</p>
    <p>When you open the app for the first time, try this :</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the 'Accept Cookies' pop-up at the bottom of the Login window.</li>
        <li>Enter your username and password. <b>Furblr does not store these credentials nor track them in any way.</b></li>
        <li>Attempt to solve the Captcha. I apologize, this will be an ordeal.</li>
        <li>If it sends you back to the login screen and you believe that you did everything correctly... close and re-open the app. Sometimes it will authenticate you correctly but not log you in.</li>
        <li>Repeat as necessary until you are in.</li>
    </ol>

With all that said, I do hope you enjoy using it. If you run into bugs or have ideas for feature requests, feel free to add a bug ticket or feature request, or message me on FA.

<big>Cheers!</big>
